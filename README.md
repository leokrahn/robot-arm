# robot-arm
## planning
### scope
The robot should be able to play Bohemian Rhapsody on a piano/virtual piano. (how it pertains to the assignment) Once we build the arm, if we have time, we will make a left hand, and we can also design it to look good. We should be able to finish the project in 2 months but it will take time and effort. The robot arm will solve the problem that we don't have a robot that plays Bohemian Rhapsody with its arm.

Week 2 (March 18-22)-----------: Finish drawings, make robot arm base

Week 3 (March 25-29)-----------: Make robot hand and print it, build the arm

Week 5 (April 8-12)------------: Code and wire to move back and forth

Week 6 (April 15-19)-----------: Code and wire the arm to move up and down

Week 7 (April 22-26)-----------: Code it so it plays Bohemian Rhapsody specifically
