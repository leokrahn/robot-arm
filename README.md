# robot-arm
## planning
### scope
The robot should be able to play Bohemian Rhapsody on a piano/virtual piano. (how it pertains to the assignment) Once we build the arm, if we have time, we will make a left hand, and we can also design it to look good. We should be able to finish the project in 2 months but it will take time and effort. The robot arm will solve the problem that we don't have a robot that plays Bohemian Rhapsody with its arm.
